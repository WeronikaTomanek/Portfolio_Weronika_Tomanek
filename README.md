## About me

Dear Recruiter, I encourage you to take a look at my porflio. I created it with the help of the Dare IT (Thank you guys, I enjoyed learning and practicing at the same time!).

I have 5 years of experience in administrative work and customer service. As an administration specialist I discovered and started testing software! How is this possible 🤔 ? The company I was working for was implementing a CRM system and I spent 2 years testing the modules of the registration and contracts department. Beta-testing, retesting, reporting bugs, analysing how to make the system more efficient - it is my thing ❤️ !

I've learned ISTQB, basic tools, good testing practices and I'm ready to join the team to work as a junior tester (with ambitions to become an automation tester 🧠 📖 💻 ).

I am looking forward to my first daily meeting as part of the team!
